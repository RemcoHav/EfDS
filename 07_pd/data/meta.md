1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This table shows the supply and the consumption of natural gas as a balance sheet. The supply of natural gas is calculated as the sum of indigenous production, production from other sources, imports minus exports, minus delivery of fuels for international shipping (bunkers) plus stock changes. The supply is equal to the amount of natural gas used in the Netherlands in the same period.

This consumption is broken down by how it's delivered by the gas distribution network. This consists of a main grid and connected regional grids. Large-scale consumers, like power plants and large companies, receive the gas directly from the main distribution network. Small-scale consumers, including households, receive their natural gas through the regional grids. Then a small amount of natural gas is used in the indigenous production and transportation of natural gas. Lastly, there is flared and vented natural gas.

Data available:
From 1946 annually and from 1982 annually, quarterly and monthly.

Status of the figures:
- up to and including 2020 definite.
- 2021 are revised provisional.
- 2022 provisional.

Changes as of 14th of MArch 2023:
Figures of February and actualised figures of January 2023 have been added.


Changes as of December 15th 2022:
Figures from 2015 until 2020 have been revised.
The gas storage capacity was added as variable.
The figures for 2015 and 2016 were published from a new database, therefore the closing stock and storage capacity was added. Furthermore the following figures were revised and improved and consistent with the Energy balance sheet.
-	Flaring
-	Own usage
-	Stock change
-	Production from other sources
-	Electricity power plants
     In the new database gas consumption is only available for electricity power plants.

Changes as of September 2022:
Figures of July and August 2022 have been added.
Because of the ongoing unrest on the Dutch and European gas markets, the Statline table for natural gas was supplemented with three additional data fields to reflect the current situation. First of all, the border crossings for gaseous gas are now reported on Statline. It remains difficult to determine the origin of this however the border crossings give an indication of the flow of natural gas. Secondly the storage capacity for gaseous gas an liquid natural gas are now being reported. This capacity will give an indication regarding the fill level of the natural gas storages. At last, the closing stocks are divided in gaseous gas and liquefied natural gas stock.

When will new figures be published?
Provisional figures: half a month after the month under review.
Revised provisional figures: not later than in July of the year following the reporting year.
Definite figures: not later than December of the second following year.


2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:
Unit:
Natural gas is published in million cubic m3 of natural gas equivalent, i.e. standard air pressure of 101.325 kPa and temperature of 0 degrees Celsius with a lower combustion value of 31.65 (MJ/m3). This unit is also known as the Groningen equivalent.

Natural gas:
Gaseous substance of natural origin mainly consisting of methane. This results from the same process that leads to the formation of crude oil. Natural gas is liquefied for transport over long distances by ship.

Liquefied natural gas (Lng):
The gas is liquefied through cooling till about minus 160 degrees Celsius. This makes transport in ships over long distances possible.

Supply of natural gas:
The amount of natural gas primarily available for consumption in the Netherlands.

Consumption of natural gas:
The amount of natural gas delivered to consumers in the Netherlands.

Indigenous production:
Extraction of natural gas from nature, on-shore and off-shore (in the Dutch territorial part of the North Sea).

Production from other sources:
Natural gas from other energy commodities transformation, e.g. natural gas production from refinery gas or natural gas production from biogas. Also known as biomethane.

Stock changes:
Stock change consists largely of stock changes of liquefied natural gas (Lng). Includes also small changes in the emergency supply of natural gas and in the natural gas pipelines. During extremely cold weather the emergency supply is used to keep the natural gas supply at the normal level. During hot weather the emergency supply is supplemented again. Change in stock is calculated as the opening stock minus the closing stock, in accordance with international energy statistics guidelines. A positive figure means that the stock has decreased, and the supply of natural gas has thus increased. A negative figure means the opposite: an increase in stock and decrease in consumption.

Bunkers:
Delivery of fuels for international shipping and aviation, i.e. ships and aircraft departing from Dutch (air)ports and arriving in foreign (air)ports. Bunkers are considered as a form of export and are not included in energy available for consumption in the Netherlands.

Explanation of symbols:

empty cell : not applicable
. : data not available or not reliable or confidential
* : provisional figure
  ** : revised provisional figure (but not definite)
  In this table an empty cell is also used for cells with value nill.

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

The survey method for this table can be found in the survey description <a href=/"/https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/methods/surveys/korte-onderzoeksbeschrijvingen/indigenous-production-transformation-and-consumption-of-energy/"/>Indigenous production, transformation and consumption of energy</a>.

The closing stocks will be aligned with <a href=/"/https://agsi.gie.eu//"/>AGSI</a> every year in January. In the other months the closing stock will be determined based on the flows as metered by Gasunie (GTS). Because of this methodology, differences between the values as published by AGSI can occur.
