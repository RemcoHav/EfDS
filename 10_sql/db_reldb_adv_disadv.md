# Advantages and Disadvantages of Relational Databases

## Advantages

- *Simplicity:* The relational database model is relatively straightforward, simple, powerful and can handle large datasets.
- *Security:* Within the same database, different users might have different access permissions to different tables.
- *Speed:* Although database models with better performance exist, still the implementations of relational databases are well established and well optimized.
- *Accuracy:* A proper design allows to avoid content duplication.
- *Multi User Collaboration:* Many users can query and modify the database simultanously.

## Disadvantages

- *Old technology:* Some people consider the model outdated.
- *Incompatibility with OOP:* Building object-oriented interfaces to a relational database is tricky.
- *Cost:* Software for and relational database design and maintenance is costly. Changes of the database structure are costly.
- *Scalability drop in Performance:* With increasing number of tables the performance drops.
- *Scalability drop in Complexity:* Structural changes of already large database increase in difficulty.
- *Lack of flexibility:* The relational model is suboptimal for unstructured data.
