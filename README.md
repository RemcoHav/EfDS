- Szymon M. Kie≈Çbasa [[LUMC/BDS](https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/biomedical-data-sciences/)], coordinator, `smkielbasa@lumc.nl`
- Ramin Monajemi [[LUMC/BDS](https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/biomedical-data-sciences/)], `rmonajemi@lumc.nl`

## Overview

The course offers a practical introduction to a few programming languages and tools currently used in data science:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose, high-level and easy to learn programming language. It provides a large number of data science libraries (e.g. machine learning, neural networks, data manipulation, data visualization).
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) is a standard language used to create, query, update and manage relational databases. For example, such databases are used in data science to store large tables with results of experiments.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool that allows to track changes in files during development of programs. It is a current standard for collaborative code development.

During the course the students will write Python programs of growing complexity (from basic coding examples to fitting a machine learning model). After the course the students shall be able to program simple reproducible data analyses (consisting of data reading, cleaning, simple modelling, and reporting steps). The state-of-the-art Python-specific data manipulation/visualization ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)) and data science libraries will be discussed.  
Fundamentals of the relational databases and of the SQL language will be presented in a context of an example database ([SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)). The database will be accessed through direct SQL statements and through high-level, object-oriented Python library ([SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)).

First, the students will work alone and practice individual code development. Later, shared code development will be practiced in groups. The students will be requested to use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to track changes in their code and to share their code with other students through [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Finally, the relevance of data stewardship and [FAIR principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) will be discussed.

## Course Objectives

- :writing_hand: use Python standard libraries (reading/writing files in different formats; `math`, `statistics`, `random`)
- :writing_hand: use common data science libraries ([NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/))
- :no_entry_sign: understand relational databases and use [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) to create, query, update a database
- :no_entry_sign: understand basics of [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for Python object-oriented database access

## Grading

- Components of the final grade:
  - **Assignments A, B, C (each of weight 1; total weight 3)**:
    - Assignments A, B and C are separately graded.
    - The grade range is 1-10 but when the primary deadline is not met then the maximum grade is 8.
    - The mean grade of Assignments A, B and C is calculated and then rounded to 0.2 steps (e.g. ...7.6, 7.8, 8.0...).
    - To pass the course, the Assignments A, B, C rounded mean grade must be greater than 5.5.
    - The Assignments A, B, C rounded mean grade has weight=3 in the final grade.
  - **Group Assignment (weight 3)**:
    - The grade range is 1-10, rounded to 0.2 steps.
    - To pass the course, the group assignment rounded grade must be greater than 5.5.
    - The group assignment rounded grade has weight=3 in the final grade.
  - **Data stewardship quiz**:
    - To pass the course, the quiz needs to be solved with the PASS result.
    - The quiz grade is not part of the final grade formula.
  - **Exam/Retake (weight 4)**:
    - The grade range is 1-10, rounded to 0.2 steps.
    - To pass the course, the exam/retake grade must be greater than 5.5.
    - The exam/retake grade has weight=4 in the final grade.
    - The exam will cover the course objectives marked with :writing_hand:.
    - The exam will not cover the course objectives marked with :no_entry_sign: - these objectives are evaluated in the group assignment and the quiz.
- Final grade:
    - The final grade is calculated as a weighted mean of the component grades.
    - To pass the course, the final grade needs to be greater or equal 6.0.
